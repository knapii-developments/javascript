# JS 30 Day challenge

Hey besties! I just started Wes Bos's JS 30 day Challenge. This folder contains projects from his challenges.

Each folder contains the contents pertaining to 1 challenge. This includes the source code and a post about the functions I use and explainations. If I don't have documentation for a project just sit tight!
